## Welcome to **litcode**! ðŸ’¡

This repo is where I store the problems I solve, along with the **thought process** that led me to the solution. Most of the time, I get the solution code from **ChatGPT**, but what Iâ€™m really sharing here is the journey to that answer.

### What youâ€™ll find here:
- **Problem-solving thought process**  
- **Solutions with code** (generated via ChatGPT, but the reasoning is what matters)  
- **Links to ChatGPT conversations** for the curious ones who want to see the back-and-forth  

Feel free to dive into the code and explanations. If youâ€™re curious about how the solutions were crafted, check out the ChatGPT conversations linked for more details. ðŸ˜‰
