## Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c

Given 3 positive numbers `a`, `b`, and `c`. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of `a` and `b` to make `(a OR b == c)`.

A flip operation consists of changing any single bit from 1 to 0 or changing a bit from 0 to 1 in their binary representation.

### Example 1:
**Input:** a = 2, b = 6, c = 5  
**Output:** 3  
Explanation: After flips, a = 1, b = 4, c = 5 such that `(a OR b == c)`.

### Example 2:
**Input:** a = 4, b = 2, c = 7  
**Output:** 1  

### Example 3:
**Input:** a = 1, b = 2, c = 3  
**Output:** 0
