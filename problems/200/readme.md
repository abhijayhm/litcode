## Problem Description

You are given an `m x n` 2D binary grid, where each element is either `1` (land) or `0` (water). Your task is to return the number of islands in the grid.

### Definition of an Island:
- An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
- You may assume that all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

## Example

### Input
```plaintext
grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
```

### Output
```plaintext
1
```

## Constraints
- The grid's dimensions are `m x n` where `1 <= m, n <= 300`.
- Each cell in the grid is either `0` or `1`.
