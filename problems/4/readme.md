# Median of Two Sorted Arrays

## Problem Description

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall runtime complexity should be **O(log(min(m, n)))**, where `m` and `n` are the sizes of the input arrays.
